<em>she/her | Full-stack developer in training @ [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/)</p></em>

<p>Hi, I'm Rhona! I studied a joint degree in History and Modern Languages and started my career working in international NGOs and the public sector. I most recently worked in a policy team in the Department of Health and Social Care supporting ministerial and stakeholder engagement for a major project. </p>
<p>But there was something missing, and in early 2022 I started learning to code, looking for a more creative career that would allow me to stretch my problem solving muscles. </p>
<p>I enrolled on a beginners Python class and haven't looked back since. I'm currently a developer in training at School of Code, and working on some personal projects in my spare time. You can see some examples in the repos below!</p>

<p>So far I've learned Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and SQL for backend; HTML, CSS and React for front-end; Jest, Cypress for testing, as well as tools like Trello, Figma and Miro for planning and design.</p>
